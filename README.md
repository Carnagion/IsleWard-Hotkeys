# Hotkeys

IsleWard - Hotkeys adds keybindings for multiple UI functions, and also provides a convenient framework for other addon authors to bind keys or combinations of keys to any arbitrary functions.

## Features

- #### New keybinds
  - L (opens/closes the leaderboard)
  - K (opens/closes the reputation list)
  - M (opens/closes the main menu)
  - Y (toggles the quests list)
  - U (toggles the events list)

## Installation

The installation procedure is different, depending on whether one is playing using a browser, or on the [IsleWard client](https://gitlab.com/Isleward/desktop-client).

- #### Client
  Refer to [this link](https://gitlab.com/Isleward/desktop-client#how-do-i-load-addons).
- #### Browser
  Install [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/). Then, install the `hotkeys.js` file as a script in ViolentMonkey.

## FAQs

- #### Will this affect other players?
  No, this is an entirely client-side addon. Only the user will be able to see the command and the page that is opened.

- #### What about performance and memory usage?
  Not a problem.
